description         Isolate functions for remote execution
long_description    Sending functions to remote processes can be wasteful of resources \
                    because they carry their environments with them. With the carrier package, \
                    it is easy to create functions that are isolated from their environment. \
                    These isolated functions, also called crates, print at the console \
                    with their total size and can be easily tested locally before being sent to a remote.
